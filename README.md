RISC_CPU  is  a  complex  digital  logic  circuit  while  the  logic  of  its  fundamental  components  is  not  complicated.  There  are  basically  8  components  in  RISC_CPU  listed  as  the  following:  Clock  generator,  Instruction  register,  Accumulator,Arithmetic  logic  unit,  Data  controller,  Status  controller,  Program  counter and Address  multiplexer.

The  instruction  mainly  consists  of  eight  instruction  sets:  HLT,  SKZ,  ADD,  AND,  XOR,  LDA,  STO,  JMP.
